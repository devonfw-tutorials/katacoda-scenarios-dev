In the `CoreModule`, you can see services like `TranslocoRootModule` (translation service), `HttpRequestInterceptorService` (HTTP interceptor sesrvice) and Angular Material related modules being part of this core module. This core module is then imported into every other module as the services are used throughout the application.




Now we want to open the file core.module.ts. 

You can either click on this link, here: 

`devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-application-template/src/app/core/core.module.ts`{{open}}

and it will open the file automatically or switch to the editor and open it yourself.
