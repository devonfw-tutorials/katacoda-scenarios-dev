In the `LayoutModule`, you can see components like `NavBar` and `Header` being part of this module. This module is comparable to a **shared** module which holds common components used throughout the application. The shared module is imported into other (feature) modules where the common components will be used.

You can study in more detail about Angular architecture by following [this document](https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/master-devon4ng.asciidoc_architecture.html#meta-architecture.asciidoc_devonfw-reference-client-architecture).




Now we want to open the file layout.module.ts. 

You can either click on this link, here: 

`devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-application-template/src/app/layout/layout.module.ts`{{open}}

and it will open the file automatically or switch to the editor and open it yourself.
