### Source file

We now have our `CobiGen_Templates` folder all set up. Next, head to the `\workspaces\main` folder in the devonfw environment. Create and name a new folder for this project, and then open it. 



Create the new folder 'main/cobigen-python-example'.

The '-p' parameter ensures, that the whole directory structure is created.

`mkdir -p main/cobigen-python-example`{{execute T1}}
