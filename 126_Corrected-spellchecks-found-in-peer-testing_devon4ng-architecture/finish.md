Conclusion

To conclude, in this tutorial you learned 
* the concepts of modules and components
* the layers of the architecture - components and services
* the different types of modules - core, shared and feature

Then we referred a devon4ng application by cloning it and traversing through its files. You can study in more detail about Angular architecture by following [this document](https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/master-devon4ng.asciidoc_architecture.html#meta-architecture.asciidoc_devonfw-reference-client-architecture).

The idea with devon4ng is to define an architecture which is a compromise between, on the one hand, leveraging the best practices and latest trends like reactive style development, on the other hand, providing a short onboarding time while still using an architecture that helps us scale and be productive at the same time.
