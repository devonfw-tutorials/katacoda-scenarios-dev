Now we want to open the file sampledata.module.ts. 

You can either click on this link, here: 

`devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-application-template/src/app/sampledata/sampledata.module.ts`{{open}}

and it will open the file automatically or switch to the editor and open it yourself. 

The application you see here is a clone of devon4ng-application-template. You can find it [here](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4ng-application-template)

The `SampleDataModule` is a nice example of the different layers explained. It holds some components (representing the *components* layer) and also has a `SampleDataService` (representing the *service* layer) which is imported in the required components.

The service acts as the adapter element explained earlier (used to make XHR calls). 



Now we want to open the file sampledata.service.ts. 

You can either click on this link, here: 

`devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-application-template/src/app/sampledata/services/sampledata.service.ts`{{open}}

and it will open the file automatically or switch to the editor and open it yourself.
