Before creating a devon4ng application, you first have to install the devonfw ide. You will find more information about devonfw on https://devonfw.com/website/pages/welcome/welcome.html.
Once you have setup devonfw ide, you are ready to create your devon4ng application. (Please wait until the devon setup completes and the command prompt appears in the integrated terminal here).


Please change the folder to &#39;devonfw/workspaces/main&#39;.

`cd devonfw/workspaces/main`{{execute T1}}


Use the ng create command to create a new Angular Project with the name level-app.
`devon ng create level-app --style=scss --routing=true --strict=false`{{execute T1}}
