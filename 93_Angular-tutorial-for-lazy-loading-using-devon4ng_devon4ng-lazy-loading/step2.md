To explain how lazy loading is implemented using angular, a basic sample app is going to be developed. This app will consist in a window named &#34;level 1&#34; that contains two buttons that redirects to other windows in a &#34;second level&#34;. It is a simple example, but useful to understand the relation between angular modules and lazy loading.


This graphic shows that modules acts as gates to access components &#34;inside&#34; them.

Because the objective of this guide is related mainly with logic, the html structure and scss styles are less relevant.
