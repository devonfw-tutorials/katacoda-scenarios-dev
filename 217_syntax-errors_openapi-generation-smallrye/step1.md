First, clone the `quarkus-quickstarts` repository from GitHub. It contains several sample applications for many extensions to Quarkus. We will use a simple REST service for this tutorial and customize the application accordingly.


Please change the folder to &#39;devonfw/workspaces/main&#39;.

`cd devonfw/workspaces/main`{{execute T1}}



Now clone the repository to your local directory.

`git clone https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-quickstarts.git`{{execute T1}}
