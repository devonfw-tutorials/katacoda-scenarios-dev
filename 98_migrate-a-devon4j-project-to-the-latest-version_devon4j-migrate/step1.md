Now, we will create sample devon4j application with name *sampleapp*. 



## Setting up your Java project

Please change the folder to &#39;devonfw/workspaces/main&#39;.

`cd devonfw/workspaces/main`{{execute T1}}

Now you can use devonfw to setup a Java project for you by executing the following 'devon' command.

`devon java create sampleapp`{{execute T1}}

cd sampleapp
In command prompt just type &#34;devon java migrate&#34;.
This will migrate current devon4j application from &#34;2020.08.001&#34; to the latest version available.
