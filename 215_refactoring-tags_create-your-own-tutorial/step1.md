Paste the URL to the &#39;git clone&#39; command to clone the repostitory. For this tutorial we will use the original tutorials repository of the &#39;devonfw-tutorials&#39; GitHub account to show the workflow of creating the tutorial.

When you run the command on your machine, you will of course need to customize the URL and add your personal GitHub name. So the command will be `git clone https://github.com/YourName/tutorials.git`.






Now clone the repository to your local directory.

`git clone https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorials.git`{{execute T1}}
