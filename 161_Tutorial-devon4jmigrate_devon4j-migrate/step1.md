To demonstrate devon4j migrate we would need a sample devon4j project with an older version, which is already created for you. You just need to clone the repository.

To clone repository you should be inside devonfw-ide installed directory. 
Execute below command, to navigate inside devonfw-ide installed directory.


Please change the folder to &#39;devonfw/workspaces/main&#39;.

`cd devonfw/workspaces/main`{{execute T1}}



Now clone the repository to your local directory.

`git clone https://github.com/devonfw-sample/devon4j-app-4tutorial.git`{{execute T1}}
