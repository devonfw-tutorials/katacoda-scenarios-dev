Execute below command for project migration from an older version to the latest version.



We want to execute the command in a different directory so you have to change your current directory.
With the next command we also open a new terminal, so you have to execute the command twice 
`cd workspace-devon4j-migrate `{{execute T1}}. 

Run devon java migrate with this bash-command.
`devon java migrate `{{execute T1}} 

You will see the message similar to the one below, if project migrated successfully.
`Successfully applied 4 migrations to migrate project from version devon4j:2020.08.001 to devon4j:2021.04.002.`

Here, 2020.08.001 is the devon4j&#39;s older version and 2021.04.002 is devon4j&#39;s latest version.
