This tutorial will show you how to use an API first approach to create a RESTful web service from an OpenAPI specification using the OpenAPI generator plugin. We will use a [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) project to demonstrate the use case. However, you can also use the OpenAPI generator in the same way for Spring.

For more information about the API fist approach, see the [devon4j documentation](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/guide-api-first.asciidoc).
For more details on the OpenAPI generator, have a look at the [official webpage](https://openapi-generator.tech/).

## Prerequisites

* Installed devonfw-ide (or at least Java and Maven installed)

## Learning goals

* You will learn how to generate REST services from OpenAPI specifications using OpenAPI generator
