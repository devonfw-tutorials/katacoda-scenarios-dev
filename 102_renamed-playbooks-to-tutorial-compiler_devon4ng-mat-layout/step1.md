Before creating a devon4ng application, you first have to install the devonfw ide. You will find more information about devonfw on https://devonfw.com/website/pages/welcome/welcome.html.
Once you have setup devonfw ide, you are ready to create your first devon4ng project.


Please change the folder to &#39;devonfw/workspaces/main&#39;.

`cd devonfw/workspaces/main`{{execute T1}}


Use the ng create command to create a new Angular Project with the name devon4ng-mat-layout.
`devon ng create devon4ng-mat-layout --style=scss --routing=true --strict=false`{{execute T1}}




Now you have to open another terminal. Click on the cd command twice and you will change to &#39;devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-mat-layout&#39; in terminal 2 automatically. Alternatively you can click on the + next to &#39;IDE&#39;, choose the option &#39;Open New Terminal&#39; and run the cd command afterwards. 


`cd devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-mat-layout`{{execute T2}}


Now build and start the app
 

`devon ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 --disable-host-check`{{execute T2 }}

For your local projects you wouldn't add '--host 0.0.0.0' and '--disable-host-check' to the ng command.


Now you can open the following link to use the app.
