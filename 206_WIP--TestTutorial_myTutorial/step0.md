Follow the Steps below to create a file.


If the parent directories aren't already in the project, 'mkdir -p' will create them for you. 

`mkdir -p /root/pathToTheFile`{{execute T1}}

Switch to the editor and click 'Copy to Editor'. 

'fileName.txt' will be created automatically inside the newly created folder.

<pre class="file" data-filename="pathToTheFile/fileName.txt">

</pre>

This should create a txt-file names fileName.
