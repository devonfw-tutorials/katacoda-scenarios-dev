Note: Setup script can take some time for setup.

First, clone the Jump-The-Queue Repository.


Please change the folder to &#39;devonfw/workspaces/main&#39;.

`cd devonfw/workspaces/main`{{execute T1}}


If the parent directories aren't already in the project, 'mkdir -p' will create them for you. 

`mkdir -p Clone Jump The Repository`{{execute T1}}

`cd  Clone Jump The Repository`{{execute T1}}


Now clone the repository to your local directory.

`git clone https://github.com/devonfw/jump-the-queue.git`{{execute T1}}
