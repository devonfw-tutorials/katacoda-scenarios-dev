Now you can go through api module of your java project and use Cobigen again to generate your front end (angular code).


## CobiGen Java


Open the following Java file in the IDE.
`devonfw/workspaces/main/cobigenjavaexample/api/src/main/java/com/example/application/cobigenjavaexample/customermanagement/logic/api/to/CustomerEto.java`{{open}}

You can use the plugin simply via the context menu. Make a right click on the Java file (in the explorer on the left or in the editor itself). The context menu will open and you can start the CobiGen Plugin by clicking on 'CobiGen'.

A terminal will open on the bottom of the IDE and CobiGen CLI will start.

You can choose the templates CobiGen should use by entering the numbers in the terminal of the IDE.

The angular code generation is done now and the generated code is stored in the workspace/main/devon4ng-applicaiton-template directory. Make sure the backend server url is configured in environments/environment.ts file.
