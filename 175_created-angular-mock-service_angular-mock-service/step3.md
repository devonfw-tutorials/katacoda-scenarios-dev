Now we want to open the file periodicElement.ts. 

You can either click on this link, here: 

`devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng/samples/AngularMockService/src/app/models/periodicElement.ts`{{open}}

and it will open the file automatically or switch to the editor and open it yourself. 

The model is represented by the interfaces we make. These interfaces describe the data structures we will use in our application. In this example, there is one data model, coresponding with the &#39;type&#39; of data that was mocked. In the models folder you will find the .ts script file that describes chemical elements. The corresponding mock file defines a set is chemical emlements objects, in accordance to our interface definition.
