### Create devon4j sample application

If you want to create devon4j application on your local machine there are two ways to do it:
* In eclipse as shown [here](https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc_tutorials.html#tutorial-newapp.asciidoc_from-eclipse)
* Using command line as shown [here](https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc_tutorials.html#tutorial-newapp.asciidoc_from-command-line)

Now, we will create sample devon4j application with name *sampleapp*. This step will guide you on how to do it.



## Setting up your Java project

Please change the folder to &#39;devonfw/workspaces/main&#39;.

`cd devonfw/workspaces/main`{{execute T1}}

Now you can use devonfw to setup a Java project for you by executing the following 'devon' command.

`devon java create com.example.application.sampleapp`{{execute T1}}

Once sampleapp is created switch to next tab of IDE. In IDE explorer you can see folder structure like devonfw-&gt; workspaces-&gt;main-&gt;sampleapp . 

sampleapp contains 3 modules i.e api, core and server.

**api**: It contains API for sampleapp.The API contains the required artifacts to interact with your application via remote services. This can be REST service interfaces, transfer-objects with their interfaces and datatypes but also OpenAPI or gRPC contracts.

**core**: It is the core of the application.In this module you can write actual business logic with service implementation, as well as entire logic layer and dataaccess layer.

**batch**: optional module for batch layer. In this example we have not created it. To add batch module while generating from commandline use -Dbatch=batch parameter. And to generate it from eclipse using mave archetype enter batch variable value as batch in project creation page.

**server**: This module bundles the entire app (core with optional batch) typically as a bootified WAR file.
