We want to execute the command in a different directory so you have to change your current directory.
With the next command we also open a new terminal, so you have to execute the command twice 
`cd cobigen-python-example `{{execute T1}}. 

Run cobigen generate user.yml -i 1 with this bash-command.
`cobigen generate user.yml -i 1 `{{execute T1}}
