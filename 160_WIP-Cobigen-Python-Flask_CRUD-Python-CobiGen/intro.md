The aim of this tutorial is to create a basic CRUD Python Flask application from a single OpenAPI .yml file declaring an entity.

The code will be generated using devonfw&#39;s CobiGen. This will result in a basic application layout, the declaration of a Flask-SQLAlchemy table with the entity&#39;s attributes as columns, and a service returning JSON objects for the GET, POST, PUT and DELETE methods.
