Great, now we can start developing.

The first step is to create a devon4j project. We will use devon IDE for that so we do not have to do it by hand.


## Setting up your Java project

Please change the folder to &#39;workspaces/main&#39;.

`cd workspaces/main`{{execute T1}}

Now you can use devonfw to setup a Java project for you by executing the following 'devon' command.

`devon java create com.example.friendexample`{{execute T1}}

Now you have an empty project.
