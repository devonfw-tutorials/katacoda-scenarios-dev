The files are created in the `target/site/servicedoc` folder. To serve them automatically when running the application, move the files to the `src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/` folder. Static files located in this folder are automatically served by Quarkus.





Run `mv target/site/servicedoc/* src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/` with this command.
`mv target/site/servicedoc/* src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/ `{{execute T1}}
